# practice
Repository to use as practice for implementations of data structures and algorithms.
5/18/2015: I have uploaded a haphazard wannabe implementation of a linkedlist that I made a while ago as well as something that I have titled as mergesort, but I don't know if it actually is or is not.  Feel free to edit anything in either of these if you'd like or start working on your own things.
